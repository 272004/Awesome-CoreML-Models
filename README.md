[Core ML](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/) brings Artificial Intelligence and iOS ever closer. However, there are few Core ML models and examples currently available. With this repo, we collect the largest list of available CoreML models, examples apps and tutorials. If you're working on a Core ML framework and is willing to share it with people, feel free to pin us on [Gitter Channel](https://gitter.im/Core-ML/Lobby#) to get added here.

## Models
* [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/) Apple provided 6 examples models for Core ML(MobileNet, SqueezeNet, Places205-GoogLeNet, ResNet50, Inception v3, VGG16).
* [Car Recognition](https://github.com/likedan/Core-ML-Car-Recognition) Recognize the car models from images.
* [YOLO](https://github.com/hollance/YOLO-CoreML-MPSNNGraph) Recognize what the objects are inside a given image and also where they are in the image.
* [FacesVisionDemo](https://github.com/cocoa-ai/FacesVisionDemo) Recognize age, gender and emotion from images of faces.
* [MNIST](https://github.com/ph1ps/MNIST-CoreML) Predict handwritten (drawn) digits from images.
* [Sentiment Polarity](https://github.com/cocoa-ai/SentimentCoreMLDemo) Predict positive or negative sentiments from sentences.
* [SentimentVision](https://github.com/cocoa-ai/SentimentVisionDemo) Predict positive or negative sentiments from images.
* [Food101](https://github.com/ph1ps/Food101-CoreML) Predict the type of foods from images.
* [Oxford102](https://github.com/cocoa-ai/FlowersVisionDemo) Detect the type of flowers from images.
* [FlickrStyle](https://github.com/SwiftBrain/awesome-CoreML-models) Detect the artistic style of images.
* [Gender Detectorv](https://github.com/cocoa-ai/NamesCoreMLDemo) Detect whether a name is for male or female.

## Sample Applications

* [Linear Regressor Example](https://github.com/likedan/CoreML-Linear-Regression)

## Tutorials

* [Machine Learning in iOS Using Core ML](https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/machine-learning-in-ios-using-core-ml/) Went through the entire cycle of generating a CoreML model with python with an example of Linear Regression.
* [Apple CoreML model conversion](http://stsievert.com/blog/2017/06/11/coreml/) How to convert a model to CoreML
* [Core ML and Vision Framework on iOS 11](http://yulingtianxia.com/blog/2017/06/19/Core-ML-and-Vision-Framework-on-iOS-11/)
