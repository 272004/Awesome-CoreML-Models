There are many Core ML examples available, but very few unique models. With this repo, we collect the largest list of unique CoreML models, so developer can experiment machine learning techniques. If you've converted a Core ML model and is willing to share it with people, feel free to submit a PR here.

## Models

*Collections of unique Core ML models*
